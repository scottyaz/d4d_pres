## Background
* [D4D](http://d4d.org) Competition to make the most of mobile phone data from Cote d'Ivoir
* How do human mobility and environmental factors drive cholera transmission
** Most mobility models parameterized using data from North America or Europe.  What about Africa? 
** Most models forumlated in terms of person to person tranmission
