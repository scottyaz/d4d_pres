## Background
* [D4D](http://www.d4d.orange.com/home) Competition to make the most of mobile phone data from Cote d'Ivoir
* How do human mobility and environmental factors drive cholera transmission
 * Most mobility models parameterized using data from North America or Europe.  What about Africa? 
 * Most models forumlated in terms of person-to-person tranmission
* Opportunity to combine detailed environmental data with mobility data to understand how disease (in this case cholera) are spread.

## Human Mobility Models

* Zipf's Law
* Gravity Models
* Radiation Models

## Mobile Phone Data

```{r echo=FALSE,comment=""}
dat <- read.table("/Users/aazman/Documents/D4D/trunk/data/POS_SAMPLE_0.TSV",sep="\t",nrows=100)
colnames(dat) <- c("id","call.time","call.tower")
head(dat)
```
