## Background
- [D4D](http://www.d4d.orange.com/home) Competition to make the most of mobile phone data from Cote d'Ivoir
- How do human mobility and environmental factors drive cholera transmission
 - Most mobility models parameterized using data from North America or Europe.  What about Africa? 
 - Most models forumlated in terms of person-to-person tranmission
- Opportunity to combine detailed environmental data with mobility data to understand how disease (in this case cholera) are spread.
